This is a personal fork where I switched the =poetry-get-virtual-env= to get the first virtual env after a PR changed the upstream to use the /current/ virtual env. The distinction is that you have to already be in the right virtual env when starting emacs to have the upstream plugin work, but this one will be able to "detect" the right virtual env to some extent. Ideally I would have a list you could choose from, but my elisp is not that good. I hope that this can help others.

* Poetry.el

  [[https://poetry.eustace.io/][Poetry]] in Emacs.

  From Poetry documentation:
  "Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you."

  ~Poetry.el~ is a wrapper around Poetry, offering a simple an intuitive interface in Emacs.

** Installation

*** From Melpa

Poetry.el is available on Melpa, the most straightforward way of installing it is to use ~use-package~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package poetry
 :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

*** Manually

   1. Dependencies

      Poetry.el needs ~transient~ and ~pyvenv~ to be installed.
      These packages are both available on MELPA.

   2. Clone the ~poetry.el~ repository:

      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      $ git clone https://github.com/galaunay/poetry.el /path/to/poetry.el
      #+END_SRC

   3. Add the following lines to ~.emacs.el~ (or equivalent):

      #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/poetry.el")
      (require 'poetry)
      #+END_SRC


** Usage

   Poetry.el uses [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] to provide a magit-like interface.
   The entry point is simply:
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x poetry
   #+END_SRC
   The interface should then be pretty much self-explanatory for poetry users:

   #+attr_html: :width 400px

   For users not familiar with how ~Poetry~ works, the [[https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/][documentation]] is a great place to start.


*** Tracking Poetry virtualenv
    ~Poetry.el~ also provides a global minor mode that automatically activate the correct virtualenv when visiting Poetry project files.
    You can activate this feature with:
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x poetry-tracking-mode
    #+END_SRC

    By default, poetry.el checks if the virtualenv needs to be updated after every command. It has the advantage of always providing the right virtualenv, but can be annoyingly slow. You can change the strategy poetry.el uses through the ~poetry-tracking-strategy~.
